# Who Am I?
Just a teenage programmer who likes networks, cybersecurity (_too stupid for this_), writing tools, and Backend Apps

## Programming
- I Like writing apps in **OOP Philosophy**, but propably I do it wrong 😅
      
        🛠️ Current Main Programming Language: TypeScript
        
        📁 Main technologies: Express, Prisma ORM, MySQL
        
        🖥️ Sometimes I like to write something in Python, but currently I'm learining C# and fundamentals of Java.
        
        🔧 I tried to write mini programs in C.
        
        🚓 Tried myself with Writing Callouts to GTA V LSPDFR mod  C#

## Future plans
